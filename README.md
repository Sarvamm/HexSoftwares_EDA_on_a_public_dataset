My first internship project at Hex Softwares,  Exploratory data analysis on a public dataset.
I have used a public dataset "Student Performance Factors" from Kaggle 
I handled missing values, cleaned the data, and performed basic statistical analysis.
Visualized data distributions, correlations, and key patterns using charts and graphs.

Toolsused: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
